# NTIA/ITS SCOS TektronixÂ® RSA Plugin

This repository is a plugin to add support for the Tektronix RSA306, RSA306B, RSA503A, RSA507A, RSA513A, RSA518A, RSA603A, and RSA607A real-time spectrum analyzers to scos-sensor. See the [scos-sensor documentation](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor/blob/master/README.md) for more information about scos-sensor, especially the section about [Actions and Hardware Support](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor/blob/master/README.md#actions-and-hardware-support).

This plugin makes use of the [RSA API by Tektronix](https://github.com/tektronix/RSA_API/). A custom [Python wrapper for this API](https://github.com/NTIA/tekrsa-api-wrap/) is also used to mask Ctypes syntax, handle error-checking, and implement helper methods.

This repository also includes many 700MHz band actions in `scos_tekrsa/configs/actions-300` and `scos_tekrsa/configs/actions-500-600`. The actions are defined separately for RSA300- and RSA500/600-series devices, allowing for preamp and attenuation control of the RSA500/600-series devices. Action classes, SignalAnalyzerInterface, and signals are used from [scos_actions](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-actions/).

For information on adding actions, see the [scos_actions documentation](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-actions/blob/master/README.md#adding-actions).

## Overview of Repo Structure

- `scos_tekrsa/configs`: This folder contains the YAML files with the parameters used to initialize the Tektronix RSA supported actions and sample calibration files.
- `scos_tekrsa/discover`: This includes the code to read YAML files and make actions available to scos-sensor.
- `scos_tekrsa/hardware`: This includes the Tektronix RSA implementation of the signal analyzer interface. It also includes supporting calibration and test code.

## Running in scos-sensor

Requires pip>=18.1 (upgrade using `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`).

Below are the steps to run scos-sensor with the scos-tekrsa plugin:

1. Clone scos-sensor: `git clone https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor.git`. 

2. Navigate to scos-sensor: `cd scos-sensor`
    - While testing locally, run: `cd scripts && ./create_localhost_cert.sh` to generate the necessary SSL certificates.

3. While in the scos-sensor root directory, create the `env` file by copying the template file: `cp env.template ./env`

4. In the `env` file, set `BASE_IMAGE` to `BASE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ntia/scos-tekrsa/tekrsa_usb:0.1.5`

    - While this repository is private, authentication with the GitHub Container Registry is required.
    - If using a personal access token, ensure the scope includes `read:packages`
    - If your personal access token is stored at `~/token.txt`, authenticate by running `cat ~/token.txt | docker login ghcr.io -u <GITHUB_USERNAME> --password-stdin`

5. In `scos-sensor/src/requirements.in`, remove or comment any unnecessary dependencies (such as scos_usrp), then add the scos_tekrsa dependency:

`scos_tekrsa @ git+https://github.com/NTIA/scos-tekrsa@main#egg=scos_tekrsa`

6. Download the [RSA API for Linux](https://www.tek.com/spectrum-analyzer/rsa306-software/rsa-application-programming-interface--api-for-64bit-linux--v100014) from Tektronix. Place the three files `libRSA_API.so`, `libcyusb_shared.so`, and `cyusb.conf` in the directory `scos-sensor/drivers`.

7. Create a `files.json` file in `scos-sensor/drivers` containing:

```json
{
    "scos_files": [
        {
            "source_path": "cyusb.conf",
            "dest_path": "/etc/cyusb.conf"
        }
    ]
}
```

8. (While this repository is private) Edit `docker/Dockerfile-api` by commenting or removing the following lines:

```
ARG DOCKER_GIT_CREDENTIALS
RUN git config --global credential.helper store && echo "${DOCKER_GIT_CREDENTIALS}" > ~/.git-credentials
```

and adding the following line:

```
RUN git config --global url."https://<GITHUB_PAT>:@github.com/".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
```

In which `<GITHUB_PAT>` is replaced by your GitHub personal access token.

10. Get environment variables: `source ./env`

10. Build and start containers: `docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate`

11. Optionally, view logs: `docker-compose logs -f`

## Development

### Updating the `tekrsa_usb` package

To build, tag the version as X.X.X, and push the updated image to the GitHub Container Registry, run:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t tekrsa_usb .
docker tag takrsa_usb ghcr.io/ntia/scos-tekrsa/tekrsa_usb:X.X.X
docker push ghcr.io/ntia/scos-tekrsa/tekrsa_usb:X.X.X
```

### Requirements and Configuration

Requires pip>=18.1 (upgrade using `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`) and python>=3.7.

It is highly recommended that you first initialize a virtual development environment using a tool such as conda or venv. The following commands create a virtual environment using venv and install the required dependencies for development and testing.

```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip # upgrade to pip>=18.1
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements.txt file is intended for dependencies needed for installation into scos-sensor. It does not include dependencies already in scos-sensor.

#### Using pip-tools

It is recommended to keep direct dependencies in a separate file. The direct dependencies are in the requirements.in and requirements-dev.in files. Then pip-tools can be used to generate files with all the dependencies and transitive dependencies (sub-dependencies). The files containing all the dependencies are in requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt. Run the following in the virtual environment to install pip-tools:

```bash
python -m pip install pip-tools
```

To update requirements.txt after modifying requirements.in:

`pip-compile requirements.in`

To update requirements-dev.txt after modifying requirements-dev.in:

`pip-compile requirements-dev.in`

Use pip-sync to match virtual environment to requirements-dev.txt:

`pip-sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt`

For more information about pip-tools, see [https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)

### Running Tests
A docker container is used for testing. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) in order to run tests.

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile-test -t rsa_test .
docker run rsa_test
```
