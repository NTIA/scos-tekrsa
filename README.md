[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

This repository is a plugin to add support for the Tektronix RSA306, RSA306B, RSA503A,
RSA507A, RSA513A, RSA518A, RSA603A, and RSA607A real-time spectrum analyzers to
SCOS Sensor. See the
[SCOS Sensor documentation](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor/blob/master/README.md)
for more information about SCOS Sensor, especially the section about
[Actions and Hardware Support](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor/blob/master/README.md#actions-and-hardware-support).

This plugin requires the
[RSA API for Linux](https://github.com/tektronix/RSA_API/) by Tektronix.
A custom [Python wrapper for this API](https://github.com/NTIA/tekrsa-api-wrap/) is also
used to mask Ctypes syntax, handle error-checking, and implement helper methods.

This repository also includes many 700 MHz band actions in
`scos_tekrsa/configs/actions-300` and CBRS band (3550-3700 MHz) actions in `scos_tekrsa/configs/actions-500-600`.
Actions are defined separately for RSA300- and RSA500/600-series devices, allowing for
preamp and attenuation control of the RSA500/600-series devices. Action classes,
`SignalAnalyzerInterface`, and signals are used from the [SCOS Actions Plugin](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-actions/).

For information on adding actions, see the [SCOS Actions Plugin documentation](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-actions/blob/master/README.md#adding-actions).

## Overview of Repo Structure

- `scos_tekrsa/configs`: Contains sample calibration files and the YAML files with the
parameters used to initialize the Tektronix RSA supported actions
- `scos_tekrsa/discover`: Includes the code to read YAML files and make actions
available to `scos-sensor`
- `scos_tekrsa/hardware`: Includes an implementation of the signal analyzer interface for
Tektronix RSA devices, along with supporting test code

## Running in SCOS Sensor

Requires `git` and `pip-tools>=6.6.2`

Below are the steps to run SCOS Sensor with the SCOS Tektronix RSA plugin:

1. Clone `scos-sensor`:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned scos-sensor directory:

    ```bash
    cd scos-sensor
    ```

3. If testing locally, generate the necessary SSL certificates by running:

    ```bash
    cd scripts && ./create_localhost_cert.sh
    ````

4. While in the `scos-sensor` directory, create the `env` file by copying the template
file:

    ```bash
    cp env.template ./env
    ```

5. In the newly created `env` file, set `BASE_IMAGE` to `BASE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ntia/scos-tekrsa/tekrsa_usb:0.1.5`

6. In `scos-sensor/src/requirements.in`, remove or comment any unnecessary dependencies
(such as `scos_usrp`), then add the `scos_tekrsa` dependency: `scos_tekrsa @ git+https://github.com/NTIA/scos-tekrsa@1.0.0`

7. Compile requirements by running:

    ```bash
    cd src
    pip-compile requirements.in
    pip-compile requirements-dev.in
    ```

8. Download the [RSA API for Linux](https://www.tek.com/spectrum-analyzer/rsa306-software/rsa-application-programming-interface--api-for-64bit-linux--v100014)
from Tektronix. Place the three files `libRSA_API.so`, `libcyusb_shared.so`, and
`cyusb.conf` in the directory `scos-sensor/drivers`.

9. Create a `files.json` file in `scos-sensor/drivers` containing:

    ```json
    {
        "scos_files": [
            {
                "source_path": "cyusb.conf",
                "dest_path": "/etc/cyusb.conf"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

10. Get environment variables:

    ```bash
    source ./env
    ```

11. Build and start containers (and optionally, view logs):

    ```bash
    docker-compose build --no-cache
    docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```

## Development

### Updating the `tekrsa_usb` package

To build, tag the version as X.X.X, and push the updated image to the GitHub Container
Registry, run:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t tekrsa_usb .
docker tag tekrsa_usb ghcr.io/ntia/scos-tekrsa/tekrsa_usb:X.X.X
docker push ghcr.io/ntia/scos-tekrsa/tekrsa_usb:X.X.X
```

### Requirements and Configuration

Requires `pip>=18.1` and `python>=3.7`.

It is highly recommended that you first initialize a virtual development environment
using a tool such as [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv).
The following commands create a virtual environment using venv and install the required
dependencies for development and testing.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip # upgrade to pip>=18.1
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Using pip-tools

It is recommended to keep direct dependencies in a separate file. The direct
dependencies are in the `requirements.in` and `requirements-dev.in` files. Then pip-tools
can be used to generate files with all the dependencies and transitive dependencies
(sub-dependencies). The files containing all the dependencies are in `requirements.txt` and
`requirements-dev.txt`. Run the following in the virtual environment to install pip-tools:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pip-tools
```

To update `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` after modifying `requirements.in`
or `requirements-dev.in`:

```bash
pip-compile requirements.in
pip-compile requirements-dev.in
```

Use `pip-sync` to match virtual environment to `requirements-dev.txt`:

```bash
pip-sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt
```

For more information, see [pip-tools' documentation](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

### Running Tests

A Docker container is used for testing. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
in order to run tests.

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile-test -t rsa_test .
docker run rsa_test
```

### Committing

Besides running the test suite and ensuring that all tests are passing, we also expect
all Python code that's checked in to have been run through an auto-formatter. This project
uses a Python auto-formatter called [Black](https://github.com/psf/black). Additionally,
import statement sorting is handled by [isort](https://github.com/pycqa/isort).

There are several ways to auto-format your code before committing. First, IDE integration
with on-save hooks is very useful. Second, if you already pip-installed the development
requirements from the section above, you already have a utility called pre-commit that
will automate setting up this project's pre-commit Git hooks. Simply type the following
once, and each time you make a commit, it will be appropriately auto-formatted.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

You can also manually run the pre-commit hooks on the entire project:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

In addition to Black and isort, various other pre-commit tools are enabled including [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint).
See [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) for the list of pre-commit
tools enabled for this repository.
