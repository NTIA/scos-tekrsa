This repository is a plugin to add support for the Tektronix RSA306, RSA306B, RSA503A,
RSA507A, RSA513A, RSA518A, RSA603A, and RSA607A real-time spectrum analyzers to
SCOS Sensor, developed by [NTIA/ITS]. See the
[SCOS Sensor documentation](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor/blob/master/README.md)
for more information about SCOS Sensor, especially the section about
[Actions and Hardware Support](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor/blob/master/README.md#actions-and-hardware-support).

This plugin requires the
[RSA API for Linux](https://github.com/tektronix/RSA_API/) by Tektronix.
A custom [Python wrapper for this API](https://github.com/NTIA/tekrsa-api-wrap/) is also
used to mask Ctypes syntax, handle error-checking, and implement helper methods.

This repository also includes many 700 MHz band actions in
`scos_tekrsa/configs/actions-300` and CBRS band (3550-3700 MHz) actions in `scos_tekrsa/configs/actions-500-600`.
Actions are defined separately for RSA300- and RSA500/600-series devices, allowing for
preamp and attenuation control of the RSA500/600-series devices. Action classes,
`SignalAnalyzerInterface`, and signals are used from the [SCOS Actions Plugin](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-actions/).

For information on adding actions, see the [SCOS Actions Plugin documentation](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-actions/blob/master/README.md#adding-actions).

## Overview of Repo Structure

- `scos_tekrsa/configs`: Contains example calibration files and the YAML files with the
parameters used to initialize the Tektronix RSA supported actions
- `scos_tekrsa/discover`: Includes the code to read YAML files and make actions
available to `scos-sensor`
- `scos_tekrsa/hardware`: Includes an implementation of the signal analyzer interface for
Tektronix RSA devices, along with supporting test code

## Running in SCOS Sensor

Requires `git`, `python>=3.8`, `pip>=18.1`, and `pip-tools>=6.6.2`

Below are the steps to run SCOS Sensor with the SCOS Tektronix RSA plugin:

1. Clone `scos-sensor`:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor.git
    ```

1. Navigate to the cloned `scos-sensor` directory:

    ```bash
    cd scos-sensor
    ```

1. If testing locally, generate the necessary SSL certificates by running:

    ```bash
    cd scripts && ./create_localhost_cert.sh
    ````

1. While in the `scos-sensor` directory, create the `env` file by copying the template
file:

    ```bash
    cp env.template ./env
    ```

1. In the newly-created `env` file, set the `BASE_IMAGE`:

    ```text
    BASE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ntia/scos-tekrsa/tekrsa_usb:latest
    ```

1. Get environment variables:

    ```bash
    source ./env
    ```

1. In `scos-sensor/src/requirements.in`, remove or comment any unnecessary dependencies
(such as `scos_usrp`), then add the `scos_tekrsa` dependency:

    ```text
    scos_tekrsa @ git+https://github.com/NTIA/scos-tekrsa@3.0.1
    ```

1. Compile requirements by running:

    ```bash
    cd src
    pip-compile requirements.in
    pip-compile requirements-dev.in
    ```

1. Download the [RSA API for Linux](https://www.tek.com/spectrum-analyzer/rsa306-software/rsa-application-programming-interface--api-for-64bit-linux--v100014)
from Tektronix. Place the three files `libRSA_API.so`, `libcyusb_shared.so`, and
`cyusb.conf` in the directory `scos-sensor/drivers`.

1. Create a `files.json` file in `scos-sensor/drivers` containing:

    ```json
    {
        "scos_files": [
            {
                "source_path": "cyusb.conf",
                "dest_path": "/etc/cyusb.conf"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Build and start containers (and optionally, view logs):

    ```bash
    docker-compose build --no-cache
    docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```

## Development

### Development Environment

Set up a development environment using a tool like
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv), with `python>=3.8`.
Then, from the cloned directory, install the development dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install .[dev]
```

This will install the project itself, along with development dependencies for pre-commit
hooks, building distributions, and running tests. Set up pre-commit, which runs
auto-formatting and code-checking automatically when you make a commit, by running:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

The pre-commit tool will auto-format Python code using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)
and [isort](https://github.com/pycqa/isort). Other pre-commit hooks are also enabled, and
can be found in [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml).

### Updating the `scos_tekrsa` package

This project uses [Hatchling](https://github.com/pypa/hatch/tree/master/backend) as a
backend. Hatchling makes versioning and building new releases easy. The package version can
be updated easily by using any of the following commands.

```bash
hatchling version major   # 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0
hatchling version minor   # 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
hatchling version micro   # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
hatchling version "X.X.X" # 1.0.0 -> X.X.X
```

To build a new release (both wheel and sdist/tarball), run:

```bash
hatchling build
```

### Updating the `tekrsa_usb` package

To build, tag the version as X.X.X, and push the updated image to the GitHub Container
Registry, run:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t tekrsa_usb .
docker tag tekrsa_usb ghcr.io/ntia/scos-tekrsa/tekrsa_usb:X.X.X
docker push ghcr.io/ntia/scos-tekrsa/tekrsa_usb:X.X.X
```

### Running Tests

The `scos_tekrsa` plugin is tested using [`tox`](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) and the [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)
framework. The following commands can be used to run tests and show coverage reports.

```bash
pytest          # faster, but less thorough
tox             # test code in virtual environments for multiple versions of Python
tox --recreate  # To recreate the virtual environments used for testing
```
