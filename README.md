# NTIA/ITS SCOS TektronixÂ® RSA Plugin[^disclaimer]

This repository is a plugin to add support for the Tektronix RSA306, RSA306B, RSA503A,
RSA507A, RSA513A, RSA518A, RSA603A, and RSA607A real-time spectrum analyzers to
scos-sensor. See the
[scos-sensor documentation](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor/blob/master/README.md)
for more information about scos-sensor, especially the section about
[Actions and Hardware Support](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor/blob/master/README.md#actions-and-hardware-support).

This plugin makes use of the
[RSA API by Tektronix](https://github.com/tektronix/RSA_API/).
A custom [Python wrapper for this API](https://github.com/NTIA/tekrsa-api-wrap/) is also
used to mask Ctypes syntax, handle error-checking, and implement helper methods.

This repository also includes many 700MHz band actions in
`scos_tekrsa/configs/actions-300` and CBRS band actions in `scos_tekrsa/configs/actions-500-600`.
Actions are defined separately for RSA300- and RSA500/600-series devices, allowing for
preamp and attenuation control of the RSA500/600-series devices. Action classes,
`SignalAnalyzerInterface`, and signals are used from [scos_actions](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-actions/).

For information on adding actions, see the [scos_actions documentation](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-actions/blob/master/README.md#adding-actions).

## Overview of Repo Structure

- `scos_tekrsa/configs`: This folder contains the YAML files with the parameters used to
initialize the Tektronix RSA supported actions and sample calibration files.
- `scos_tekrsa/discover`: This includes the code to read YAML files and make actions
available to `scos-sensor`.
- `scos_tekrsa/hardware`: This includes the Tektronix RSA implementation of the signal
analyzer interface. It also includes supporting test code.

## Running in scos-sensor

Requires `pip>=18.1` (upgrade using `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`).

Below are the steps to run scos-sensor with the scos-tekrsa plugin:

1. Clone scos-sensor: `git clone https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor.git`.

2. Navigate to scos-sensor: `cd scos-sensor`
    - While testing locally, run: `cd scripts && ./create_localhost_cert.sh` to generate
    the necessary SSL certificates.

3. While in the scos-sensor root directory, create the `env` file by copying the template
file: `cp env.template ./env`

4. In the `env` file, set `BASE_IMAGE` to `BASE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ntia/scos-tekrsa/tekrsa_usb:0.1.5`

5. In `scos-sensor/src/requirements.in`, remove or comment any unnecessary dependencies
(such as `scos_usrp`), then add the `scos_tekrsa` dependency:

    `scos_tekrsa @ git+https://github.com/NTIA/scos-tekrsa@1.0.0`

6. Compile `requirements.txt` by running: `pip-compile requirements.in`

7. Download the [RSA API for Linux](https://www.tek.com/spectrum-analyzer/rsa306-software/rsa-application-programming-interface--api-for-64bit-linux--v100014)
from Tektronix. Place the three files `libRSA_API.so`, `libcyusb_shared.so`, and
`cyusb.conf` in the directory `scos-sensor/drivers`.

8. Create a `files.json` file in `scos-sensor/drivers` containing:

    ```json
    {
        "scos_files": [
            {
                "source_path": "cyusb.conf",
                "dest_path": "/etc/cyusb.conf"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

9. Get environment variables: `source ./env`

10. Build and start containers: `docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate`

11. Optionally, view logs: `docker-compose logs -f`

## Development

### Updating the `tekrsa_usb` package

To build, tag the version as X.X.X, and push the updated image to the GitHub Container
Registry, run:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t tekrsa_usb .
docker tag tekrsa_usb ghcr.io/ntia/scos-tekrsa/tekrsa_usb:X.X.X
docker push ghcr.io/ntia/scos-tekrsa/tekrsa_usb:X.X.X
```

### Requirements and Configuration

Requires `pip>=18.1` (upgrade using `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`) and `python>=3.7`.

It is highly recommended that you first initialize a virtual development environment
using a tool such as conda or venv. The following commands create a virtual environment
using venv and install the required dependencies for development and testing.

```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip # upgrade to pip>=18.1
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Using `pip-tools`

It is recommended to keep direct dependencies in a separate file. The direct
dependencies are in the `requirements.in` and `requirements-dev.in` files. Then `pip-tools`
can be used to generate files with all the dependencies and transitive dependencies
(sub-dependencies). The files containing all the dependencies are in `requirements.txt` and
`requirements-dev.txt`. Run the following in the virtual environment to install `pip-tools`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pip-tools
```

To update `requirements.txt` after modifying `requirements.in`:

```bash
pip-compile requirements.in
```

To update `requirements-dev.txt` after modifying `requirements-dev.in`:

```bash
pip-compile requirements-dev.in
```

Use `pip-sync` to match virtual environment to `requirements-dev.txt`:

```bash
pip-sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt
```

For more information about `pip-tools`, see [https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)

### Running Tests

A Docker container is used for testing. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
in order to run tests.

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile-test -t rsa_test .
docker run rsa_test
```
